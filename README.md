# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview 
We are running an analysis on weather patterns in Hawaii in order to win over our potential investor, W. Avy, to invest in our dream of opening a surf and shake shop on Oahu. Our potential investor has concerns on if the weather in Hawaii will cause dips in sales of ice cream. We have run an analysis to hopefully ease his concerns. 


## Results
We ran our analysis on the temperatures in June and December to account for some variety in our weather:

![December_temps](https://github.com/MeredithTracy/Surfs_Up_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/December_temps.png)


-	Our average temperature for June was 75° compared to 71° in December. 
-	The minimum recorded temperature for June was 64° and the maximum was 85° meaning there is a 21-degree range. 
-	The minimum recorded temperature for December was 56° and the maximum was 83° creating a 27-degree range. 


## Summary
Overall, the temperatures stay fairly consistent year-round. While there is a slightly larger range in temperature in December and likely the corresponding winter months, the maximum and minimum temperatures were not that far apart (2-degrees and 8-degrees respectively). 


## Continuing our Analysis
To continue our analysis, I would want to look more into precipitation levels for each month.  While it may not be too cold for ice cream, constant rain may impact sales. We could even get more specific with that to look at temperature and rain together since Hawaii is tropical and sometimes it can be warm temperature wise and still rain. We could also continue looking at statistics for more than these two months.
